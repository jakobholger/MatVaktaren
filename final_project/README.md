#### Description:
My project Auriva Finance, marked a significant milestone as my second website ever created, inspired
by my new finance interest along with my interest in programming. The foundation of the project was 
the week 9s assignment "Finance". Recognizing the potential for expansion beyond its initial scope, I envisioned transforming it into a robust and competitive paper trading platform.

Auriva Finance features comprehensive functionalities, enabling users to seamlessly buy and sell stocks, and inquire about current interest rates, including futures and forex trading. The quoting feature utilizes real-time data from the Yahoo finance API to gather valuable information which is then transformed into graphs and percentages spanning from the past year's financial development. The index page presents a daily development of your portfolio, a fully dynamic experience presenting an overview of your gains and losses. 

In addition to other features, Auriva Finance also features a leaderboard to fit the paper trading's competitive nature. This leaderboard ranks users based on their overall net worth on the website and illustrates their dominance by indicating the percentage of total capital under their control.

However, the project is not without its aspirations. One feature I am missing is an addition to my database which would track each user's current net worth daily and then the website would be able to calculate the development of each account over time. Thus, I would be able to show a graph or show progress over time as a useful statistic for the user but also a fun way to see which person has found the most profitable trades in a period.

The project has not only enhanced my understanding of website development but also created a deeper interest in cybersecurity. Managing the database and user actions necessitated a comprehensive approach to control input on both the back-end and front-end. Stringent measures were implemented for input validation and authentication, fortifying the project against potential security threats while maintaining a stylistic website.

Embarking on this endeavor proved both challenging and intriguing. Unlike my previous localized projects such as games or computer functionalities, Auriva Finance required a deeper understanding of building a website from scratch. In turn, I developed my programming skill set even further. To summarise, this project has been a pivotal experience in my journey to become a fully fletched programmer teaching me new programming languages and modules required for back-end and front-end development, expanding my capabilities for future projects.
